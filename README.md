# Neoris Lab: Java and Angular Basics

This repository contains the code for a lab project completed at Neoris, focusing on the basics of Java and Angular development. The lab consisted of two main components: an API to handle employee data using Spring Boot and Java, and an Angular frontend that leverages the full capacity of the API.

## Java API

The Java API is built using Spring Boot and various Java tools and libraries. It provides full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for managing employee data. Key skills and tools utilized in the development of the API include:

- Spring Boot: Used as the framework for building the RESTful API.
- Java: The primary programming language for developing the API.
- Lombok: Used to reduce boilerplate code and improve code readability by automatically generating getters, setters, and other common Java code.
- Other Spring Boot Tools: Leveraged various tools provided by Spring Boot, such as Spring Data JPA for database interactions and Spring Web for handling HTTP requests.

The API allows creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting employee records, providing a comprehensive backend for the application.

## Angular Frontend

The Angular frontend is developed to fully utilize the capabilities of the Java API. It serves as the user interface for interacting with the employee data and employs various Angular features and libraries. The key highlights of the Angular implementation are:

- Angular: The frontend framework used to build the user interface and handle API interactions.
- Angular Material: A popular UI component library used for styling and enhancing the user experience.
- Angular Material Components: Utilized various components from the Angular Material library, including tables, popovers, modals, sorting, and confirmation toast events.
- Full API Integration: The Angular frontend seamlessly integrates with the Java API, allowing users to perform CRUD operations on employee data.

The lab project demonstrates the ability to leverage Angular's capabilities and effectively consume the provided API endpoints, providing a user-friendly and interactive frontend for managing employee information.

Please note that this README provides a high-level overview of the skills and tools utilized in the lab project, focusing on the technical aspects without delving into the actual implementation details.
